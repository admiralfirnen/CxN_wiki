Artifacts:

Artifacts do not wear down like equipment does. Artifacts have might of their own. Unlike what you may have heard, artifacts do not 'belong' to specific captains!! They should be used where the need best suits them. You should be swapping them around to best suit the situation. Artifacts can be improved in two ways, artifact level and star level. Artifact level increases the power only. Star level increases the power and also gives random new powers when each star is complete. New bonus power can then be locked, unlocked, and swapped in and out to further customize the artifact. I will only cover the base powers here.
