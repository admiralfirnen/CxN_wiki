Kingdom 277 Rules of Engagement (ROE)

within Kingdom 277. They are based on historical Palace rules and Senate
voting. Acceptance of ROE implies acceptance of Court authority and
enforcement including enforcement by Royal Guard

clans that explicitly state in their clan description that they follow
K277 ROE. - Clanless players and non-ROE clans are NOT protected (except where provisioned by IKFPA) -
