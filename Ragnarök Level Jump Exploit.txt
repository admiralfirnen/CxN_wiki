Ragnarök Level Jump Exploit

This exploit works when you are doing research going from one guardsman level to the next. It allows for a massive growth ability if done properly. The key to this exploit involves NOT entering the games Ragnarök menu directly so ensure you read all the way through before entering the menu! 

Step 1) Enter the Academy and begin research on your next level of Guardsman. For this example we will say that you already use G5 and you will begin research on G6. Do not complete the research. Do this before the reset. 

Step 2) When the event starts, DO NOT click on anything in the event or enter the event at all. Attack the wolf and snake with your G5 troops directly. Get the location from the Kingdom chat right at reset or from a clanmate. 

Step 3) Still without clicking on anything in the event, return to the academy and complete the G6 research. 

Step 4) Still without clicking on anything in the event, return to the wolf and the snake and attack with G6 troops directly. 

Step 5) Without clicking on anything in the event, close the game. 

Step 6) Restart the game. You now have G6 troops, but the wolf and the snake will be stuck at G5 level. You can now enter the event and the shops.
