# 🏹 Total Battle – *The Great Hunt* Clan Strategy Guide

This document outlines our **official clan strategy** for *The Great Hunt* event in **Total Battle**.  
Please read carefully and follow these guidelines to maximize clan points while minimizing troop losses.

---

## 🛡️ Event Overview – What Is *The Great Hunt*?

**The Great Hunt** is a **clan-based tournament** where players complete **monster kill contracts** to earn points for the clan leaderboard.

### 🔑 Key Mechanics
- Each player starts with **10 contracts**
- Contracts vary by **difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert*)
- Any monster squad that matches the contract description counts
- Higher difficulty = more points
- Clan ranking is based on **total points earned**

> ⚠️ *Expert difficulty is unlocked by manually increasing contract difficulty*

---

## 🕑 Clan Bonus Window (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 🔥 2-Hour Clan Bonus
- The clan can activate **one 2-hour bonus window**
- During this time:
  - **All contract points are DOUBLED**
- The exact activation time will be **announced by leadership**

### ✅ Strategy
- **Save as many contracts as possible**
- Hunt **primarily during the bonus window**
- Plan buffs, troops, and revives ahead of time

---

## 🔄 Contracts & Refresh Strategy

### ♻️ Free Refreshes
- Each player receives **3 FREE refreshes**
- A refresh replaces your **entire list of contracts**

### 💰 Paid Refreshes
- Additional refreshes can be purchased with **gold**
- Recommended for competitive players or strong armies

### ✅ Clan Rules
- ✔ **Use all 3 free refreshes**
- ✔ Add paid refreshes *if you can afford them*
- ❌ Do NOT struggle with bad or impossible contracts

### 🔁 Refresh vs Overextending
- It is **always better** to:
  - ✔ Refresh and complete a **full new contract list**
  - ❌ Than complete a single contract at **80–100% losses**
- High-loss hits destroy long-term efficiency and progress

---

## ⚔️ Contract Difficulty & Optimization

### 📈 Rolling & Scaling Difficulty
- Automatically roll **Easy contracts upward**
- Target a loss range of **20–37%**
  - **0–4% losses are NOT optimal** unless already at Hard
- Once you can comfortably handle Hard:
  - ✔ Roll **all contracts to Expert**

### 🎯 Difficulty Rule of Thumb
- Losses too low → contracts too easy → wasted potential  
- Losses too high → inefficient → refresh instead

---

## 🧪 Contract Testing Order

### 🧠 Top-Down Testing
- Always **test contracts from the TOP of the list first**
- Goal: Complete **the entire list without reviving**
- Adjust difficulty early if needed before committing troops

---

## 🪖 Troop Management & Loss Control

### ⚠️ Loss Threshold
- **Do NOT overextend**
- Keep estimated troop losses **≤ 37%**
- High losses cost more than they gain in points

---

## 🧩 Monster Matchups & Army Composition

### 🐲 Counter the Monster Type
- Always review **monster strengths**
- Send troop types the monsters are **NOT strong against**

### 🧱 Optimal Army Stack Setup
- Use:
  - 🟦 **ONE LARGE stack** of the optimal troop type
  - 🟩 Followed by **many medium stacks** of the SAME troop type
  - ➕ Add monsters / mercenaries
- Goal:
  - Burst damage to **wipe monsters before the next attack round**

This significantly reduces losses when done correctly.

---

## 🏅 Hero, Captain & Dragon Optimization

### 📊 Hero-to-Captain Ratio (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Optimal ratio for The Great Hunt:
  - **2.5:1 or 3:1 (Hero : Captain)**

#### What the Ratio Means
- ❌ Lower than 2.5:1 → Contracts are too hard
- ❌ Higher than 3:1 → You lose the ability to use the Dragon for bonus leadership

---

## 🐉 Dragon Usage Rules

### 🚨 Dragon Is NOT Automatic
- ONLY use the Dragon if it:
  - ✅ **Reduces loss percentage**

### 🧠 How to Check
1. Select the Dragon by default
2. Remove the Dragon
3. Compare loss percentage:
   - If it **does NOT change** → leave Dragon home
   - If it **does decrease losses** → use Dragon

> ⚠️ Dragon uses are limited over a long contract run. Spend them wisely.

---

## 📊 Buffs & Boosts (Strongly Recommended)

Before hunting, activate personal buffs if available:

### 💪 Recommended Buffs
- ⚔️ Army Strength
- 🛡️ Army Health
- 🏅 Valor Points
- 🎖️ Any applicable combat boosts

Buffs dramatically improve efficiency during the clan bonus window.

---

## 🚫 Rare Contracts (Optional)

- Some players **opt out of Rare contracts**
- Reason: Avoid unintentionally leveling their Hero
- This is **optional and player preference**

---

## ❌ What NOT To Do

- ❌ Do NOT rely on reinforcements (they don’t count)
- ❌ Do NOT force impossible contracts
- ❌ Do NOT ignore the clan bonus window
- ❌ Do NOT burn troops for single high-loss hits
- ❌ Do NOT waste Dragon uses without loss reduction

---

## ✅ Clan Checklist Summary

✔ Hunt during the **2-hour clan bonus**  
✔ Use **all 3 free refreshes**  
✔ Refresh instead of taking **80–100% loss hits**  
✔ Roll contracts to hit **20–37% losses**  
✔ Test contracts **top-down**  
✔ Counter monster strengths with proper troop types  
✔ Optimize **Hero : Captain = 2.5–3 : 1**  
✔ Use Dragon **only if losses decrease**  
✔ Activate buffs before hunting  

---

## 🏆 Final Note

*The Great Hunt* rewards **discipline, optimization, and timing**, not reckless force.  

Follow this strategy and our clan will consistently outperform stronger but less organized clans.

Good hunting! 🐲🔥
